I love programming and gaming. I also enjoy combining both of those things.

I am a very techincal person, what I mean by that is that I like to understand
how things works most of the time. I enjoy games like Stormworks,
Scrap Mechanic and more for that reason. I also enjoy RPG and Open World games.
