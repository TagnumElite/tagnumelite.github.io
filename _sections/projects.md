### Open Source

I have many open-source projects. You can find most of the on
[GitHub](https://github.com/TagnumElite?tab=repositories) but I do have
accounts on other sites!

### Games

I don't make games but I do mod games.
Most of the time my mods can be found on
GitHub(Source-Code), [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/53227396?tab=user+files) or [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/id/TagnumElite/myworkshopfiles/)
